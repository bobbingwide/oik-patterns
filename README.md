Exports and imports patterns for the block editor.

## Description 
Enables loading and display of a theme's patterns even when the theme is not active.

Also loads patterns from selected themes which don't include their own logic.


## Installation 
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/oik-patterns` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. For each theme which delivers patterns use the preview_theme=theme query parameter to load the cache with the theme's patterns.


## Frequently Asked Questions 

# Which patterns are loaded? 

- Any .html file in the theme's patterns folder.
- Cached patterns for a selected theme
- During preview, if the cached versions are out of date with respect to the theme they are re-cached.

# Are these patterns translatable? 

Yes, if we use my proposal for internationalization and localization of templates and template parts
AND if I implement code to look in the user's current locale.
